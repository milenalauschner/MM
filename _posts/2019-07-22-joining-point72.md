Some exciting personal news: I've _(finally)_ graduated from [The Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome), and I'm joining [Point72 Asset
Management](https://www.point72.com/) as a data scientist/research analyst!

Point72 is an American hedge fund, headquartered in Connecticut. I'll be based
in New York, working out of their [Hudson
Yards](https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/work/55-hudson-yards) offices.

In this next chapter of my life, my professional focuses are:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian methods and deep learning, mostly.
1. **Open source.** I've been involved with developing
   [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4). These are exciting times for the
   PyMC project: I hope to keep contributing!

My four years of college were incredibly rewarding, but I'm excited to enter the
real world. Stay tuned!
